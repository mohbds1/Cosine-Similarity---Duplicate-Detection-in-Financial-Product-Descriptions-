# 💹 Duplicate Detection in Financial Product Descriptions with Cosine Similarity  

This project demonstrates how to use **TF-IDF** and **Cosine Similarity** to detect potential duplicates in financial product descriptions. It’s designed to be both **educational** and **practical**, making it a good starting point for anyone interested in text similarity or duplicate detection in structured datasets.

## 🚀 Features  
- Load and explore dataset  
- Convert text into TF-IDF vectors  
- Compute pairwise cosine similarity  
- Visualize similarity distribution  
- Identify most and least similar text pairs  
- Apply a threshold to flag duplicates  
- Export results for further analysis

Required Libraries:

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn

📊 Example Output

Distribution of cosine similarity scores

Top 10 most similar text pairs

Least similar text pairs

Duplicate candidates flagged above a threshold (e.g., 0.85)
